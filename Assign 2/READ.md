## Problems Faced in the Assignment
First of all we learned about Kaggle as we did not know about this website. We then came to know that Kaggle allows users to find and publish data sets, explore and build models in a web-based data-science environment, work with other data scientists and machine learning engineers, and enter competitions to solve data science challenges. </br>
Then on Kaggle we joined the "Tabular Playground Series - May 2022" competition. We faced some problems in joining the competition but we identified a workaround for it. After joining the competition or next step was to write a python code that will be submitted on Kaggle which will then generate our score based on the code.</br>
We got stuck in writing the program, however, our professor helped us with a few things and we learned about different libraries in pyhton which finally helped us completing the code.

## Contributions
**11070 Kamisha Salim:** Created a Assign 2 repository, added a READ.md and python code file and also submitted the code file on Kaggle.</br>
</br>
**11041 Bilal Shoukat:** Worked on the python program with Kashan  </br>
</br>
**62803 Murtaza Memon:** Learned about different python libraries and chose the suitable libraries that needed to be added to the python program. </br>
</br>
**64055 Muhammad Kashan:** Downloaded the test.csv file and supervised the python program with Bilal.
