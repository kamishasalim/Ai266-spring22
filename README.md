### Bilal Shoukat
My name is Bilal shoukat. i have done my intermediate in computer science from C.A.S collage in 2019 . Reason of my choosing computer science is the I have little bit interest in the field, and I don’t want to study chemistry. After completing my bachelor’s in computer science I want to do MBA in marketing for my future goals and my future goals are to stablish my own business. First, I will do job and gather some amount to start my own startup and my hobbies are to play football watching series and gather information about marketing.
