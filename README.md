## About Us
### Kamisha
I'm Salim, Kamisha Salim. Having completed my intermediate as a **Computer Science** student from **Aga Khan Higher Secondary School, Karachi (AKHSS,K)**, in 2019, I'm currently enrolled as a **Computer Science** major at **PAF Karachi Institute of Economics & Technology (KIET)**.
I am a human friendly *(social)* animal and an animal friendly human. I love cats, cats love me too. I like playing Badminton and also know how to swim *(incase I have to jump off a ship in the middle of a sea)*. I look forward to learn how to bicycle because I want to minimize my carbon footprint.
